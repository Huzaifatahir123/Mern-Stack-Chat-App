this project is created with mern stack A simple chat app with Socket io the goal was to learn socket and realtime data transfer 
duirng the creation of projects i have encountered many issue 
the main issue was lack of plaining this project realized me how essential is project planing 
before starting code you have to know what is the problem how you are going to tackle it 
define your schema First and review it whether it is scaleable or not if not then there is no point of creating project 
the greatere the plaining easier it is going to create it 
each and every feature must be planned first once the project planing is done now move to start coding 
never write any line of code which you do not understand fully this is going to cause a great trouble for you  in future
and things will get unthinkable complex and you will be left with no option
